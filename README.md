Visualizing Global Trends with World Bank Data üåçüìä
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I worked on an engaging project involving World Bank datasets to analyze and visualize global trends in population, income groups, and regions.

Here‚Äôs what I accomplished:
‚úÖ Population Trends: Using a dataset with population data from 1960 to 2023, I created:
Bar charts to visualize population sizes of countries for each year.
Country-specific bar charts showcasing population trends over the decades, providing clear insights into growth patterns.
‚úÖ Income Group and Regional Analysis: For another dataset, I:
Plotted pie charts and bar charts to illustrate the distribution of countries by income groups (High income, Upper middle income, Lower middle income, Low income).
Visualized the regional distribution of countries across categories like Europe & Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America & Caribbean.

I used Python, along with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for crafting insightful and visually engaging charts.
This experience honed my skills in data handling, visualization, and storytelling, and I‚Äôm excited to continue applying these abilities to unlock valuable insights from data. #ProdigyInfoTech
